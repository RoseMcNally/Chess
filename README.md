# Chess
C++ project to build a chess engine.

### Usage

Download the code and compile the executable according to the makefile instructions. 

Call the main function by running `chess` in the command line. This will run the game defined in the `main.cpp` file. 

Play around with the program - you can write your own chess games and try it out! Let me know if you catch any bugs :)

Also, check out the header files to see how the model is designed.
